### **1. Introduction**


Autonomous agents leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) present a transformative approach to
decision-making by replicating human processes and workflows across various applications. These
systems enhance the problem-solving capabilities of language agents by equipping them with tools
and enabling collaboration with other agents, effectively breaking down complex problems into
manageable components (Havrilla et al., 2024; Park et al., 2023; Talebirad and Nadiri, 2023; Tang et al.,
2024). One prominent application of these autonomous frameworks is in the financial market—a
highly complex system influenced by numerous factors, including company fundamentals, market
sentiment, technical indicators, and macroeconomic events.
Traditional algorithmic trading systems often rely on quantitative models that struggle to fully capture the complex interplay of diverse factors. In contrast, LLMs excel at processing and understanding
natural language data, making them particularly effective for tasks that require textual comprehension,
such as analyzing news articles, financial reports, and social media sentiment. Additionally, deep
learning-based trading systems often suffer from low explainability, as they rely on hidden features
that drive decision-making but are difficult to interpret. Recent advancements in multi-agent LLM
frameworks for finance have shown significant promise in addressing these challenges. These frameworks create explainable AI systems, where decisions are supported by evidence and transparent

reasoning (Li et al., 2023a; Wang et al., 2024c; Yu et al., 2024), demonstrating the potential in financial
applications.
Despite their potential, most current applications of language agents in the financial and trading
sectors face two significant limitations:
**Lack of Realistic Organizational Modeling:** Many frameworks fail to capture the complex
interactions between agents that mimic the structure of real-world trading firms (Li et al., 2023a;
Wang et al., 2024c; Yu et al., 2024). Instead, they focus narrowly on specific task performance, often
disconnected from the organizational workflows and established human operating procedures proven
effective in trading. This limits their ability to fully replicate and benefit from real-world trading
practices.
**Inefficient Communication Interfaces:** Most existing systems use natural language as the primary
communication medium, typically relying on message histories or an unstructured pool of information
for decision-making (Park et al., 2023; Qian et al., 2024). This approach often results in a “telephone
effect”, where details are lost, and states become corrupted as conversations lengthen. Agents
struggle to maintain context and track extended histories while filtering out irrelevant information
from previous decision steps, diminishing their effectiveness in handling complex, dynamic tasks.
Additionally, the unstructured pool-of-information approach lacks clear instructions, forcing logical
communication and information exchange between agents to depend solely on retrieval, which
disrupts the relational integrity of the data.
In this work, we address these key limitations of existing models by introducing a system that
overcomes these challenges. First, our framework bridges the gap by simulating the multi-agent
decision-making processes typical of professional trading teams. It incorporates specialized agents
tailored to distinct aspects of trading, inspired by the organizational structure of real-world trading
firms. These agents include fundamental analysts, sentiment/news analysts, technical analysts,
and traders with diverse risk profiles. Bullish and bearish debaters evaluate market conditions to
provide balanced recommendations, while a risk management team ensures that exposures remain
within acceptable limits. Second, to enhance communication, our framework combines structured
outputs for control, clarity, and reasoning with natural language dialogue to facilitate effective debate
and collaboration among agents. This hybrid approach ensures both precision and flexibility in
decision-making.
We validate our framework through experiments on historical financial data, comparing its
performance against multiple baselines. Comprehensive evaluation metrics, including cumulative
return, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown, are employed to assess its overall effectiveness.

### **2. Related Work**


**2.1.** **LLMs as Financial Assistants**


Large Language Models (LLMs) are applied in finance by fine-tuning on financial data or training
on financial corpora. This improves the model’s understanding of financial terminology and data,
enabling a specialized assistant for analytical support, insights, and information retrieval, rather than
trade execution.
**Fine-Tuned LLMs for Finance**
Fine-tuning enhances domain-specific performance. Examples include PIXIU (FinMA) (Xie et al.,
2023), which fine-tuned LLaMA on 136K finance-related instructions; FinGPT (Touvron et al., 2023;
Yang et al., 2023b), which used LoRA to fine-tune models like LLaMA and ChatGLM with about 50K

TradingAgents: Multi-Agents LLM Financial Trading Framework


finance-specific samples; and Instruct-FinGPT (Zhang et al., 2023a), fine-tuned on 10K instruction
samples from financial sentiment analysis datasets. These models outperform their base versions and
other open-source LLMs like BLOOM and OPT (Zhang et al., 2022) in finance classification tasks, even
surpassing BloombergGPT (Wu et al., 2023) in several evaluations. However, in generative tasks, they
perform similarly or slightly worse than powerful general-purpose models like GPT-4, indicating a
need for more high-quality, domain-specific datasets.
**Finance LLMs Trained from Scratch**
Training LLMs from scratch on finance-specific corpora aims for better domain adaptation. Models
like BloombergGPT (Wu et al., 2023), XuanYuan 2.0 (Zhang et al., 2023b), and Fin-T5 (Lu et al.,
2023) combine public datasets with finance-specific data during pretraining. BloombergGPT, for
instance, was trained on both general and financial text, with proprietary Bloomberg data enhancing
its performance on finance benchmarks. These models outperform general-purpose counterparts like
BLOOM-176B and T5 in tasks such as market sentiment classification and summarization. While they
may not match larger closed-source models like GPT-3 or PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), they offer
competitive performance among similar-sized open-source models without compromising general
language understanding.
In summary, finance-specific LLMs developed through fine-tuning or training from scratch show
significant improvements in domain-specific tasks, underscoring the importance of domain adaptation
and the potential for further enhancements with high-quality finance-specific datasets.

**V. FUND MANAGER** : The fund manager approves and executes the trade.


**2.2.** **LLMs as Traders**


LLMs act as trader agents making direct trading decisions by analyzing external data like news,
financial reports, and stock prices. Proposed architectures include news-driven, reasoning-driven, and
reinforcement learning (RL)-driven agents.
**News-Driven Agents**
News-driven architectures integrate stock news and macroeconomic updates into LLM prompts
to predict stock price movements. Studies evaluating both closed-source models (e.g., GPT-3.5, GPT4) and open-source LLMs (e.g., Qwen (Bai et al., 2023), Baichuan (Yang et al., 2023a)) in financial

TradingAgents: Multi-Agents LLM Financial Trading Framework


sentiment analysis have shown the effectiveness of simple long-short strategies based on sentiment
scores (Lopez-Lira and Tang, 2023). Further research on fine-tuned LLMs like FinGPT and OPT
demonstrates improved performance through domain-specific alignment (Kirtac and Germano, 2024;
Zhang et al., 2024a). Advanced methods involve summarizing news data and reasoning about their
relationship with stock prices (Fatouros et al., 2024a; Wang et al., 2024b).
**Reasoning-Driven Agents**
Reasoning-driven agents enhance trading decisions through mechanisms like reflection and debate.
Reflection-driven agents, such as FinMem (Yu et al., 2023) and FinAgent (Zhang et al., 2024b), use
layered memorization and multimodal data to summarize inputs into memories, inform decisions,
and incorporate technical indicators, achieving superior backtest performance while mitigating hallucinations (Ji et al., 2023). Debate-driven agents, like those in heterogeneous frameworks (Xing, 2024)
and TradingGPT (Li et al., 2023b), enhance reasoning and factual validity by employing LLM debates
among agents with different roles, improving sentiment classification and increasing robustness in
trading decisions.
**Reinforcement Learning-Driven Agents**
Reinforcement learning methods align LLM outputs with expected behaviors, using backtesting
as rewards. SEP (Koa et al., 2024) employs RL with memorization and reflection to refine LLM
predictions based on market history. Classical RL methods are also used in trading frameworks that
integrate LLM-generated embeddings with stock features, trained via algorithms like Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) (Ding et al., 2023; Schulman et al., 2017).


**2.3.** **LLMs as Alpha Miners**


LLMs are also used to generate alpha factors instead of making direct trading decisions. QuantAgent
(Wang et al., 2023) demonstrates this by leveraging LLMs to produce alpha factors through an innerloop and outer-loop architecture. In the inner loop, a writer agent generates a script from a trader’s
idea, while a judge agent provides feedback. In the outer loop, the code is tested in the real market,
and trading results enhance the judge agent. This approach enables progressive approximation of
optimal behavior.
Subsequent research, such as AlphaGPT (Wang et al., 2023), proposes a human-in-the-loop framework for alpha mining with a similar architecture. Both studies showcase the effectiveness of LLMpowered alpha mining systems, highlighting their potential in automating and accelerating the
development of trading strategies by generating and refining alpha factors.

### **3. TradingAgents: Role Specialization**


Assigning LLM agents clear, well-defined roles with specific goals enables the breakdown of complex
objectives into smaller, manageable subtasks. Financial trading is a prime example of such complexity,
demanding the integration of diverse signals, inputs, and specialized expertise. In the real world,
this approach to managing complexity is demonstrated by trading firms that rely on expert teams to
collaborate and make high-stakes decisions, underscoring the multifaceted nature of the task.
In a typical trading firm, vast amounts of data are collected, including financial metrics, price
movements, trading volumes, historical performance, economic indicators, and news sentiment. This
data is then analyzed by quantitative experts (quants), including mathematicians, data scientists, and
engineers, using advanced tools and algorithms to identify trends and predict market movements.

TradingAgents: Multi-Agents LLM Financial Trading Framework


Inspired by this organizational structure, TradingAgents defines seven distinct agent roles within a
simulated trading firm: Fundamentals Analyst, Sentiment Analyst, News Analyst, Technical Analyst,
Researcher, Trader, and Risk Manager. Each agent is assigned a specific name, role, goal, and set of
constraints, alongside predefined context, skills, and tools tailored to their function. For example, a
Sentiment Analyst is equipped with tools like web search engines, Reddit search APIs, X/Twitter
search tools, and sentiment score calculation algorithms, while a Technical Analyst can execute code,
calculate technical indicators, and analyze trading patterns. More specifically, TradingAgents assumes
the following teams.


**3.1.** **Analyst Team**


The Analyst Team (Figure **2** ) is composed of specialized agents responsible for gathering and analyzing
various types of market data to inform trading decisions. Each agent focuses on a specific aspect of
market analysis, bringing together a comprehensive view of the market’s conditions.


**Fig. 2** : TradingAgents Analyst Team


 - **Fundamental Analyst Agents** : These agents evaluate company fundamentals by analyzing
financial statements, earnings reports, insider transactions, and other pertinent data. They assess
a company’s intrinsic value to identify undervalued or overvalued stocks, providing insights
into long-term investment potential.


 - **Sentiment Analyst Agents** : These agents process large volumes of social media posts, sentiment
scores, and insider sentiments derived from public information and social media activity. They
gauge market sentiment to predict how collective investor behavior might impact stock prices in
the short term.

TradingAgents: Multi-Agents LLM Financial Trading Framework


 - **News Analyst Agents** : These agents analyze news articles, government announcements, and
other macroeconomic indicators to assess the market’s macroeconomic state, major world events,
and significant company changes. They identify news events that could influence market
movements, helping to anticipate sudden shifts in market dynamics.


 - **Technical Analyst Agents** : These agents calculate and select relevant technical indicators, such
as Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) and Relative Strength Index (RSI), customized for specific assets. They analyze price patterns and trading volumes to forecast future
price movements, assisting in timing entry and exit points.


Collectively, the Analyst Team synthesizes data from multiple sources to provide a holistic market
analysis. Their combined insights form the foundational input for the Researcher Team, ensuring that
all facets of the market are considered in subsequent decision-making processes.


**3.2.** **Researcher Team**


The Researcher Team (Figure **3** ) is responsible for critically evaluating the information provided by
the Analyst Team. Comprised of agents adopting both bullish and bearish perspectives, they engage
in multiple rounds of debate to assess the potential risks and benefits of investment decisions.


**Fig. 3** : TradingAgents Researcher Team: Bullish Perspectives and Bearish Perspectives


 - **Bullish Researchers** : These agents advocate for investment opportunities by highlighting positive indicators, growth potential, and favorable market conditions. They construct arguments
supporting the initiation or continuation of positions in certain assets.


 - **Bearish Researchers** : Conversely, these agents focus on potential downsides, risks, and unfavorable market signals. They provide cautionary insights, questioning the viability of investment
strategies and highlighting possible negative outcomes.


Through this dialectical process, the Researcher Team aims to reach a balanced understanding of
the market situation. Their thorough analysis helps in identifying the most promising investment
strategies while anticipating possible challenges, thus aiding the Trader Agents in making informed
decisions.


**3.3.** **Trader Agents**


Trader Agents (Figure **4** ) are responsible for executing trading decisions based on the comprehensive
analysis provided by the Analyst Team and the nuanced perspectives from the Researcher Team. They

assess the synthesized information, considering both quantitative data and qualitative insights, to
determine optimal trading actions.


**Fig. 4** : TradingAgents’s Trader Decision-Making Process


The tasks of TradingAgents Trader include:


 - Evaluating recommendations and insights from analysts and researchers.


  - Deciding on the timing and size of trades to maximize trading returns.


  - Placing buy or sell orders in the market.


 - Adjusting portfolio allocations in response to market changes and new information.


Trader Agents must balance potential returns against associated risks, making timely decisions in
a dynamic market environment. Their actions directly impact the firm’s performance, necessitating a
high level of precision and strategic thinking.


**3.4.** **Risk Management Team**


The Risk Management Team (Figure **5** ) monitors and controls the firm’s exposure to various market
risks. These agents continuously evaluate the portfolio’s risk profile, ensuring that trading activities
remain within predefined risk parameters and comply with regulatory requirements.
The responsibilities of Risk Management Team include:


  - Assessing factors such as market volatility, liquidity, and counterparty risks.


  - Implementing risk mitigation strategies, such as setting stop-loss orders or diversifying holdings.


 - Providing feedback to Trader Agents on risk exposures and suggesting adjustments to trading
strategies.


  - Ensuring that the overall portfolio aligns with the firm’s risk tolerance and investment objectives.


By offering oversight and guidance, the Risk Management Team helps maintain the firm’s financial
stability and protect against adverse market events. They play a crucial role in safeguarding assets
and ensuring sustainable long-term performance.
All agents in TradingAgents follow the ReAct prompting framework (Yao et al., 2023), which
synergizes reasoning and acting. The environment state is shared and monitored by the agents,
enabling them to take context-appropriate actions such as conducting research, executing trades,
engaging in debates, or managing risks. This design ensures a collaborative, dynamic decision-making
process reflective of real-world trading systems.

### **4. TradingAgents: Agent Workflow**


**4.1.** **Communication Protocol**


Most existing LLM-based agent frameworks use natural language as the primary communication
interface, typically through structured message histories or collections of agent-generated messages
(Fatouros et al., 2024b; Li et al., 2023a; Yang et al., 2023c, 2024). However, relying solely on natural language often proves insufficient for solving complex, long-term tasks that require extensive
planning horizons. In such cases, pure natural language communication can resemble a game of
telephone—over multiple iterations, initial information may be forgotten or distorted due to context
length limitations and an overload of text that obscures critical earlier details (Hong et al., 2024). To
address this limitation, we draw inspiration from frameworks like MetaGPT, which adopt a structured
approach to communication. Our model introduces a structured communication protocol to govern
agent interactions. By clearly defining each agent’s state, we ensure that each role only extracts or
queries the necessary information, processes it, and returns a completed report. This streamlined
approach reduces unnecessary steps, lowers the risk of message corruption, and keeps interactions
focused and efficient, even in complex, long-horizon tasks.


**4.2.** **Types of Agent Interactions**


In contrast to previous multi-agent trading frameworks, which rely heavily on natural language
dialogue, TradingAgents agents communicate primarily through structured documents and diagrams.
These documents encapsulate the agents’ insights in concise, well-organized reports that preserve
essential content while avoiding irrelevant information. By utilizing structured reports, agents can
query necessary details directly from the global state, eliminating the need for lengthy conversations
that risk diluting information, extending the message state indefinitely, and causing data loss. The
types of documents and the information they contain are detailed below:
**I. Analyst Team** : Fundamental, sentiment, news, and technical analysts compile their research and
findings into concise analysis reports specific to their areas of expertise. These reports include key
metrics, insights, and recommendations based on their specialized analyses.
**II. Traders** : Traders review and analyze the reports from the analysts, carefully deliberating to
produce clear decision signals. They accompany these decisions with detailed reports explaining their
rationale and supporting evidence, which are later utilized by the risk management team.
Agents engage in natural language dialogue exclusively during agent-to-agent conversations


8


TradingAgents: Multi-Agents LLM Financial Trading Framework


and debates. These concise, focused discussions have been shown to promote deeper reasoning
and integrate diverse perspectives, enabling more balanced decisions in complex, long-horizon
scenarios—a method particularly relevant to the intricate environment of trading (Du et al., 2023). This
approach seamlessly integrates with our structured framework, as the conversation state is recorded
as a structured entry within the overall agent state. The types of communication in these scenarios are
detailed below:
**III. Researcher Team** : Each researcher agent queries the global agent state for analyst reports
and carefully forms their opinion. Two researchers represent opposing perspectives: one bullish and
one bearish. They engage in natural language dialogue for _n_ rounds, as determined by the debate
facilitator agent. At the conclusion, the facilitator reviews the debate history, selects the prevailing
perspective, and records it as a structured entry in the communication protocol.
**IV. Risk Management Team** : The risk management team, similar to the researcher team, queries
the trader’s decision and accompanying report. They then deliberate from three perspectives—riskseeking, neutral, and risk-conservative—to adjust the trading plan within risk constraints. They
engage in _n_ rounds of natural language discussion, guided by a facilitator agent.
**V. Fund manager** : The fund manager reviews the discussion from the risk management team,
determines the appropriate risk adjustments, and updates the trader’s decision and report states
within the communication protocol.


**4.3.** **Backbone LLMs**


To meet the diverse complexity and speed demands of tasks in our framework, we strategically
select Large Language Models (LLMs) based on their strengths. Quick-thinking models, such as
`gpt-4o-mini` and `gpt-4o`, efficiently handle fast, low-depth tasks like summarization, data retrieval,
and converting tabular data to text (OpenAI et al., 2024). In contrast, deep-thinking models like
`o1-preview` excel in reasoning-intensive tasks such as decision-making, evidence-based report writing,
and data analysis. These models leverage their architectures for multi-round reasoning, producing
logically sound, in-depth insights (OpenAI, 2024; Wang et al., 2024a; Zhong et al., 2024). Additionally,
we prioritize models with proven reliability and scalability to ensure optimal performance across
various market conditions. We also employ auxiliary expert models for specialized tasks like sentiment
analysis.
Specifically, all analyst nodes rely on deep-thinking models to ensure robust analysis, while quickthinking models handle data retrieval from APIs and tools for efficiency. Researchers and traders use
deep-thinking models to generate valuable insights and support well-informed decisions. By aligning
the choice of LLMs with the specific requirements of each task, our framework achieves a balance
between efficiency and depth of reasoning, which is crucial for effective trading strategies.
This implementation strategy ensures that TradingAgents can be deployed without requiring a
GPU, relying only on API credits. It also introduces seamless exchangeability of backbone models,
enabling researchers to effortlessly replace the model with any locally hosted or API-accessible
alternatives in the future. This adaptability supports the integration of improved reasoning models or
finance-tuned models customized for specific tasks. As a result, TradingAgents is highly scalable and
future-proof, offering flexibility to accommodate any backbone model for any of its agents.

### **5. Experiments**


**5.1.** **Simulation Setup**


We evaluate our TradingAgents framework using a comprehensive backtesting simulation from
January 1st to March 29th, 2024, across major technology stocks including Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft,
Meta, and Google. TradingAgents facilitates seamless plug-and-play strategies during the simulation,
enabling straightforward comparisons with any baseline. Agents make decisions based solely on data
available up to each trading day, ensuring no future data is used (eliminating look-ahead bias). Based
on their analysis, TradingAgents generates trading signals to buy, sell, or hold assets, which are then
executed. Afterward, analysis metrics are calculated before proceeding to the next day’s data.
We benchmark against five established strategies: Buy and Hold, MACD, KDJ+RSI, ZMR, and
SMA (baseline descriptions in Appendix S1.1). Performance is evaluated using four key metrics:
Cumulative Return (CR), Annualized Return (AR), Sharpe Ratio (SR), and Maximum Drawdown
(MDD) (formulations in Appendix S1.2).


**5.2.** **Back Trading**


To simulate a realistic trading environment, we utilize a multi-asset and multi-modal financial dataset
comprising of various stocks such as Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta, Google, and more. Our multimodal dataset integrates historical stock prices, news articles, social media sentiment, insider transactions, financial statements, and 60 technical indicators per asset. The dataset includes:
**Historical Stock Prices** : Open, high, low, close, volume, and adjusted close prices from January
1st, 2024, to March 29th, 2024.
**News Articles** : Daily news updates are gathered from diverse sources such as Bloomberg, Yahoo,
EODHD, FinnHub, and Reddit, covering specific company developments, global events, macroeconomic trends, and government updates.
**Social Media Posts and Sentiment** : Posts from Reddit, X/Twitter, and other platforms along with
sentiment scores of posts calculated by auxiliary language models.
**Insider Sentiments and Transactions** : Sentiment derived from public information, including
transactions from SEDI and relevant company filings.
**Financial Statements and Earnings Reports** : Quarterly and annual reports filed by companies.
**Company Profiles and Financial History** : Descriptions of company profiles, target industries, and
financial history reported by third parties.
**Technical Indicators** : Sixty standard technical analysis indicators calculated for each asset, including MACD, RSI, Bollinger Bands, etc.

### **6. Results and Analysis**


In this section, we present the experimental results and analyze the performance of TradingAgents in
comparison to the baseline models.

Table **1** and Figures **6**, **7**, S1, S2, S3, and S4 demonstrate that our method outperforms existing
rule-based trading baselines, particularly in profitability, as measured by returns. TradingAgents
achieves at least a 23.21% cumulative return and a 24.90% annual return on the three sampled
stocks, surpassing the best-performing baselines by a margin of 6.1%. Notably, on $AAPL stock—a
particularly challenging case due to market volatility during the testing period—traditional methods
struggled, as their patterns failed to generalize to this situation. In contrast, TradingAgents excelled
under these adverse conditions, achieving returns exceeding 26% within months.

**Fig. 7** : Cumulative Returns on $AAPL using **TradingAgents** . The figure shows the performance comparison of
our model against baseline approaches for Apple Inc. stock analysis.


**6.1.2.** **Sharpe Ratio**


The Sharpe Ratio [†] performance highlights TradingAgents’s exceptional ability to deliver superior riskadjusted returns, surpassing all baseline models. This result underscores TradingAgents’s effectiveness
in balancing returns and risk— a crucial factor for sustainable and predictable investment growth.
TradingAgents outperforms market benchmarks such as Buy-and-Hold and rule-based strategies
consistently, demonstrating its adaptability. Its capability to maximize returns while maintaining
controlled risk exposure establishes a strong foundation for multi-agent and debate-based automated
trading algorithms.


**6.1.3.** **Maximum Drawdown**


While rule-based baselines demonstrated superior performance in controlling risk, as reflected by
their maximum drawdown scores, they fell short in capturing high returns. This trade-off between
risk and reward underscores TradingAgents’s strength as a balanced approach. Despite higher
returns being typically associated with higher risks, TradingAgents maintained a relatively low
maximum drawdown compared to many baselines. Its effective risk-control mechanisms, facilitated
by the debates among risk-control agents, ensured that the maximum drawdown remained within a


†We benchmarked TradingAgents over 3 months due to intensive LLM and tool use (11 LLM calls & 20+ tool calls/prediction). The highest Sharpe Ratio exceeds our expected empirical range ( _SR_ above 2 – very good, above 3 – excellent).
We exported TradingAgents’s decision sequences and examined them to ensure calculation correctness. We believe the
exceptionally high _SR_ resulted from the phenomenon that there were few pullbacks in TradingAgents during that period.
We report results as they are in our experiments faithfully. Future work will optimize LLM reasoning & tool use to enable
longer backtesting under limited budgets.

manageable limit, not exceeding 2. This demonstrates TradingAgents’s capability to strike a robust
balance between maximizing returns and managing risk effectively.


**6.1.4.** **Explainability**


A major drawback of current deep learning methods for trading is their dense, complex architectures,
often rendering trading agents’ decisions indecipherable. This challenge, rooted in AI explainability,
is critical for trading agents operating in real-world financial markets, where incorrect decisions can
cause severe losses.
In contrast, an LLM-based agentic framework offers a transformative advantage: its decisions
are communicated in natural language, enhancing interpretability. To illustrate, we provide TradingAgents’s full trading log for a single day in the Appendix, showcasing its use of the ReAct-style
prompting framework (Yao et al., 2023). Each decision includes detailed reasoning, tool usage, and
thought processes, enabling traders to understand and debug the system. This transparency empowers
traders to fine-tune the framework, accounting for decision factors, offering superior explainability
over deep-learning trading algorithms.


**6.2.** **Discussion**


Our results demonstrate that integrating multiple specialized LLM agents and fostering agentic debate
significantly enhances trading performance. This framework efficiently synthesizes diverse data
sources and expert analyses, enabling trader agents to make well-informed decisions tailored to
specific risk profiles. The inclusion of a reflective agent and a dedicated risk management team is
pivotal in refining strategies and mitigating risks. As a result, the framework achieves exceptional
return capture while maintaining strong risk management metrics, striking an optimal balance between
maximizing rewards and minimizing risks. Additionally, the natural language-based operations of the
multi-agent LLM framework ensure high explainability, giving TradingAgents a distinct advantage
over traditional and deep learning methods in transparency and interoperability.

### **7. Conclusion**


We introduced TradingAgents, a multi-agents LLM financial trading framework that realistically
simulates a trading firm environment with multiple specialized agents engaging in agentic debates
and conversations. Leveraging the advanced capabilities of LLMs to process and analyze diverse
financial data sources, the framework enables more informed trading decisions while utilizing multiagent interactions to enhance performance through comprehensive reasoning and debate before acting.
By integrating agents with distinct roles and risk profiles, along with a reflective agent and a dedicated
risk team, TradingAgents significantly improves trading outcomes and risk management compared to
baseline models. Additionally, the collaborative nature of these agents ensures adaptability to varying
market conditions. Experiments demonstrate that TradingAgents outperforms traditional trading
strategies and baselines in cumulative return, Sharpe ratio, and other critical financial metrics. Future
work will focus on deploying the framework in a live trading environment, expanding agent roles,
and incorporating real-time data feeds to enhance performance further.

TradingAgents: Multi-Agents LLM Financial Trading Framework

### **S1. Supplementary Materials for TradingAgents**


**S1.1.** **Baseline Models**


We compare our TradingAgents framework against several baselines:


 - **Buy and Hold** : Investing equal amounts in all selected stocks and holding them throughout the
simulation period.


 - **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)** : A trend-following momentum strategy
that generates buy and sell signals based on the crossover points between the MACD line and
signal line.


 - **KDJ and RSI (Relative Strength Index)** : A momentum strategy combining KDJ (stochastic
oscillator) and RSI (relative strength index) indicators to identify overbought and oversold
conditions for trading signals.


 - **ZMR (Zero Mean Reversion)** : A mean reversion trading strategy that generates signals based on
price deviations from and subsequent reversions to a zero reference line.


 - **SMA (Simple Moving Average)** : A trend-following strategy that generates trading signals based
on crossovers between short-term and long-term moving averages.


**S1.2.** **Evaluation Metrics**


To thoroughly evaluate the performance of our TradingAgents framework, we use widely recognized
metrics to assess the risk management, profitability, and safety of the TradingAgents strategy in
comparison to baseline approaches. Here we describe these metrics:


**S1.2.1.** **Cumulative Return (CR)**


The cumulative return measures the total return generated over the simulation period. It is calculated
as:




  - _V_ end _−_ _V_ start
CR =

_V_ start




_×_ 100% (S1)



where _V_ end is the portfolio value at the end of the simulation, and _V_ start is the initial portfolio value.


**S1.2.2.** **Annualized Return (AR)**


The annualized return normalizes the cumulative return over the number of years:



_×_ 100% (S2)


19



1

- _N_

_−_ 1







AR =



��
_V_ end

_V_ start



where _N_ is the number of years in the simulation.

**S1.2.3.** **Sharpe Ratio (SR)**


The Sharpe ratio measures risk-adjusted return by comparing a portfolio’s excess return over the
risk-free rate to its volatility:


_R_ ¯ _−_ _R f_
SR = (S3)

_σ_

where _R_ [¯] is the average portfolio return, _R f_ is the risk-free rate (e.g., yield of 3-month Treasury
bills), and _σ_ is the standard deviation of the portfolio returns.


**S1.2.4.** **Maximum Drawdown (MDD)**


Maximum drawdown measures the largest peak-to-trough decline in the portfolio value:



MDD = max
_t∈_ [0, _T_ ]




- Peak _t_ _−_ Trough _t_

Peak _t_




_×_ 100% (S4)



**S1.3.** **Cumulative Returns (CR) and Transaction History for AMZN and GOOGL**


We present additional figures for `$AMZN` and `$GOOGL` stocks to complement the AAPL data discussed
in the main body of this paper. These supplementary visuals provide a broader perspective on
the performance of our trading framework across multiple stocks, highlighting the consistency and
robustness of TradingAgents’s results.

  indicators, here is a detailed and nuanced report of the trends observed:

### Momentum Indicators
- **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**: The RSI values indicate significant
  fluctuations, with periods of overbought conditions, particularly on November
  5 and November 7, where RSI values reached 100 and 89.85, respectively. This
  suggests strong upward price movements, potentially leading to price
  corrections. The RSI stabilizes towards the end of the period, indicating
  moderate buying momentum.

### Trend Indicators
- **ADX (Average Directional Index)**: Initially, the ADX values are extremely
  high, indicating a strong trend, but they decline significantly, suggesting a
  weakening trend strength. This pattern implies a transition from a strong
  directional movement to a potential consolidation phase.

- ** Supertrend **: The supertrend indicator remains constant, suggesting a stable
  market trend without significant volatility. This stability might indicate a
  consolidation phase, with the potential for future breakouts.

### Volatility Indicators
- ** Bollinger Bands **: The upward trend in Bollinger Bands suggests a bullish
  market phase with low volatility. The consistent rise in values indicates a
  positive market bias, with prices likely to continue rising if the trend
  persists.

- **ATR (Average True Range)**: The ATR values show an increase in market
  volatility, peaking on November 7. This suggests heightened market activity,
  with sustained volatility towards the end of the period.

### Volume Indicators
- **VR (Volume Variation Index)**: The VR values highlight significant
  fluctuations in trading volume, with a notable spike on November 5. This
  indicates heightened market activity, possibly due to external factors
  influencing trader behavior.

### Price Action and Support/Resistance
- **CCI (Commodity Channel Index)**: The CCI values indicate volatility, with
  several instances of overbought conditions. Peaks on November 7, November 14,
  and November 18 suggest strong upward price movements, which could be followed
   by corrections.

### Moving Averages
- ** MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)**: The MACD values indicate a
  general upward trend, with some fluctuations and minor pullbacks. The
  increasing MACD values suggest bullish market sentiment, with the short -term
  moving average consistently above the long -term average.

### Summary and Insights
The analysis of AAPL ’s recent market data reveals a period of volatility with
  alternating phases of strong buying momentum and stabilization . The initial
  overbought conditions and high ADX values suggest a strong trend, which
  weakens over time, indicating potential consolidation . The consistent upward
  trend in Bollinger Bands and MACD values points to a bullish market sentiment,
   while the fluctuations in ATR and VR values highlight ongoing market

  volatility.

Traders should be cautious of potential price corrections following the overbought
   conditions and consider the possibility of continued volatility. The stable
  supertrend value suggests a consolidation phase, with potential for future
  breakouts. Overall, traders should remain vigilant, using these insights to
  adjust their strategies accordingly, while being prepared for both
  opportunities and risks presented by the current market conditions.

3. ** Inflation and Federal Reserve Policy **: The October CPI inflation report
  showed a rise to 2.6%, indicating that the Federal Reserve ’s management of
  inflation is on track. However, this has increased the likelihood of a pause
  in rate cuts, affecting market expectations and investor sentiment.

### Sector -Specific Insights
1. ** Technology and AI**:
- ** Apple **: Apple is expanding into the smart home market with a new AI -powered
  device, competing with Amazon and Google. Despite strong earnings, there are
  concerns about overvaluation and challenges in China.
- ** Google (Alphabet)**: Google is facing pressure from AI competition in the
  search ad business and ongoing DOJ lawsuits. Analysts have mixed views on its
  stock, with some not considering it a favored stock currently.
- ** Amazon **: Amazon is making significant moves into full autonomy and expanding
  its AI services through AWS. However, its stock recently declined due to
  broader market corrections and Federal Reserve comments on interest rates.

2. ** Semiconductors **:
- ** Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC)**: The US has finalized a $6
  .6 billion subsidy for TSMC ’s semiconductor production in Arizona,
  highlighting the strategic importance of semiconductor manufacturing . Despite
  high demand driven by AI, TSMC is considered overvalued by some analysts due
  to geopolitical risks and its role in US -China economic competition.

3. ** Investment Trends **:
- **AI and Tech Stocks **: There is a continued focus on AI -centric tech giants
  like Google, Meta, TSMC, Adobe, and Broadcom for potential double -digit
  returns. The rapid adoption of generative AI is likened to the growth of
  Facebook, indicating significant investment opportunities in AI technologies.

### Market Sentiment and Investor Behavior
1. ** Portfolio Management **: Major investment firms like Fisher Asset Management
  and GMO Capital have shown increased portfolio values, with significant
  holdings in tech giants such as Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, and Alphabet
  .

2. ** Investor Interest **: There is heightened investor interest in Apple, as
  indicated by increased searches and discussions about its stock prospects.
  This reflects broader market attention on tech stocks amidst evolving economic
   conditions.

### Conclusion
The current global economic landscape is characterized by geopolitical tensions,
  particularly between the US and China, impacting multinational companies. The
  technology sector, especially AI and semiconductor industries, remains a focal
   point for investors, with significant government support and market interest.
   Inflation management by the Federal Reserve continues to influence market
  dynamics, affecting investor expectations and stock performance. Traders
  should consider these factors when making investment decisions, focusing on
  sectors with strong growth potential and navigating geopolitical risks.

  too long. Instead, a moderate approach could involve gradually building a
  position in Apple, allowing for dollar -cost averaging to mitigate the risk of
  buying at a peak.

Regarding the geopolitical and economic factors, both analysts have valid points.
  The Risky Analyst sees potential in deregulation and Apple ’s expansion into
  new markets, while the Safe Analyst rightly highlights the unpredictability of
   these factors. A balanced strategy would involve closely monitoring these
  developments and being ready to adjust positions as new information becomes
  available. Diversifying investments across different sectors or geographies
  could also help mitigate the risks associated with geopolitical tensions.

In conclusion, a moderate risk strategy would involve a careful balance of taking
  advantage of Apple ’s growth potential while safeguarding against extreme
  volatility. This could include using a mix of technical analysis to time
  entries and exits, fundamental analysis to assess long -term value, and
  diversification to spread risk. By adopting this balanced approach, investors
  can aim for steady growth without exposing themselves to unnecessary risks.
